<p><em>Please view all instruction as educational and for learning purposes ONLY. Use of these examples against targets in the real world without permission is unethical and illegal…</em></p>

<p>This tutorial covers how to do a fresh install of Kali Nethunter onto a rooted Nexus 6. 
This tutorial assumes you already have a familiarity with windows command prompt and the windows OS and an understanding
of what rooting a phone does as well as the dangers. YOU CAN BRICK YOUR DEVICE IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL. I am not responsible if you 
do somehow damage or brick your device. Do your research and understand the risks involved with this process. 
If you use another device besides the Nexus 6 I cannot garuentee it will work but the steps should be similar. Please go read up on the xda fourms for your SPECIFIC DEVICE BEFORE attempting to root it. Here are the xda fourms I visited for this project.</p>

<p>https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/general/how-to-nexus-6-one-beginners-guide-t2948481</p>

<p>If your nexus device is fresh out of the box please set it up with no password or pin. Also take a backup of pictures and contacts
before because the phone data will be erased.</p>

<p>This guide consists of 3 parts
1)Gathering nessessary tools and files and installing Nexus root kit drivers. 
2)Booting to a custom recovery image (TWRP) and rooting the phone (Magisk).
3)Flashing and installing Kali Nethunter.</p>

<p>At this point it asks for our device.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/nrt_install_2.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>I simply used the auto detect option</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/NRT_autodetect.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we can see the NRT main menu and log file. 
We will stop here to download the nessessary .apk and .zip files.</p>

<h2 id="files-requirements">Files Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Magisk</p>

    <p>https://magisk.me/</p>

    <p>Magisk is the “app” that will allow us to have root privalages on our Nexus 6.
  Here is the main web page.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/magisk_main.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you scroll down the page you will see the downloads. You will download 2 files. One is the flashable zip file and the other is the Magisk app that will be installed.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-process">Starting the process.</h2>

<p>After we have all the required files and software we can begin to install our software. 
One more tip that will help your anixety in this process is to be patient. Sometimes Nexus Root Toolkit
will ask you to wait, you need to have a shred of confidence in the tool and let it run its course. DO NOT close 
unless you are sure it is hanging. 9/10 times it is just running like normal just let it run.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/nrt_main.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Click the install drivers button and CAREFULLY and METICLOSLY follow each step.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/nrt_drivers.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>If everything is done correctly you will run the Full Driver Test and get these results in your logs. If done successfully your phone will also be rebooted from the PC.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/nrt_drivers_installed.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>If your phone reboots successfully but you see this image hanging for more then 5 min you need to go into your phone and turn on usb file transfer. See below. The phone should remain plugged in while doing this…..</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/nrt_waiting_for_your.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/nexus_pull.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/nexus_pulldown.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once changing it to file transfer you should see this success messege from Nexus Root Kit!</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/nrt_success.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>UNLOCK OEM SHOULD BE HERE</p>

<p>Lets move all our files over to the phone.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/copy_files.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now making sure your phone is plugged in and that you can see internal storage, open your file explorer to where
you placed your Android SDK Platform Tools and copy this path into a command prompt. If you are confused about this part
please stop and google “Traverseing the windows file system in CMD”. In this step we will be flashing the custom TWRP recovery image to our phone. 
From here we will install Magisk and root the phone!</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.\adb devices
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can see below that my device has been identified. If you do not see your device try to enable file sharing on the nexus 
device or plug in your phone.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/cli1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next you will reboot to the android bootloader.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.\adb reboot bootloader
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/cli2.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now you will run several fastboot commands. When you look at my output below, notice that I placed the full path (C:) to the TWRP image I downloaded. To
do this either navigate to the file and copy the path from the top bar of file explorer, or simplpy drag and drop the file
into the command prompt.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.\fastboot flash recovery "C:\PATH\TO\YOUR\TWRP-FILE.IMG"
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Once you run this command below your phone will boot to TWRP custom recovery!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.\fastboot boot "C:\PATH\TO\YOUR\TWRP-FILE.IMG"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/cli3.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>After swiping on the modification button we see the main TWRP menu system. 
Select the Install option…</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/Twrp_magisk1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Browse to where you copied the files onto your nexus internal storeage. For me it was Download.
Select the Magiskv20.4.zip and press Install Image…</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/Twrp_magisk2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Swipe to confirm flash…</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/Twrp_magisk3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>If your file is not corrupted you should see a successful insall.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/Twrp_magisk4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Press Reboot System.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/Twrp_magisk5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When the phone reboots go into your apps and check to see if the Magisk Manager was isntalled.
If it was drag Magisk onto the homescreen as it will save you time.
Open Magisk Manager…</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/magisk1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ensure that both Magiask and the Manager are up to date and isntalled.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/magisk3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When we click the upper left menu we see that SuperUser is an option.</p>

<p>Congragulations you have successfully rooted your Nexus 6!</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/Magisk4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="flashing-nethutner">Flashing Nethutner</h2>

<p>Because we have Magisk installed we should be able to access the bootloader and boot
to our custom recovery image, TWRP.</p>

<p>Hold the power and shut the phone off
Once it is off power it back up by pressing power + volume down at the same time. 
This will boot you to recovery. For a faster option plug your phone in and run these two commands again.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.\adb devices
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.\adb reboot bootloader
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we can move up the menu by the volume up button until we reach the Recovery option.
Press the power button once to select.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/Twrp_recovery.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Just like when we installed Magisk, select the nethunter image and swipe to install.</p>

<p><img src="images/nexus6/twrp_magisk/Nethunter_install.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We see it is loading up! Please be pati

Many thanks to Josiah Pierce</em></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/nmap.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>I started with a port and version scan using nmap. As we can see it revealed several regularly used ports.</p>
<ul>
  <li>port 21 - ftp</li>
  <li>port 22 - ssh</li>
  <li>port 80 - http</li>
</ul>

<p>With the service versions that were returned by nmap I employed searchsploit to see if there was any low hanging fruit, beginning with FTP.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>searchsploit proftpd-1.3.3c
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>What came back was a Metasploit module for backdoor command execution.
Booting up Metasploit I ran a search command for the module, assigned it for use, and set the parameters.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>use unix/ftp/proftdp_133c_backdoor
</code></pre></div></div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>set RHOSTS &lt;ip&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I used the <span style="color: red;">show missing</span> command to see if I had overlooked any options for the exploit, and when I was absolutely sure everything was correct, typed <span style="color: red;">run</span> and initiated my attack.</p>

<p><img src="images/whoami.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The reverse tcp shell was successful. 
After issuing a <span style="color: red;">whoami</span> command and watching <span style="color: red;">root</span> return it was time to see what other avenues I could find.</p>

<p>With my backdoor already in place I decided to pull the hashed passwords and try to crack them offline. I ran a <span style="color: red;">cat</span> command on both <span style="color: red;">/etc/shadow</span> and <span style="color: red;">/etc/passwd</span> and copied the output back to .txt files on my attacking machine named shadow.txt and passwd.txt respectively.</p>
